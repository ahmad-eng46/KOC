## Open Questions / TODOs

_(Use this section for things you've parked. Move to DECISIONS.md once resolved.)_

- [ ] Domain name to purchase: `khaliqoil.com` or alternative?
- [ ] Confirm SMS gateway: Twilio (international, easier) vs Pakistani gateway (cheaper)?
- [ ] How many staff users will the system have day 1?
- [ ] Are there any specific report formats from the legacy `.rdlc` files we need to match exactly?
- [ ] Confirm: backup frequency default = 7 days? _(seeded as 7 for now)_
- [ ] Confirm: default for "include home expenses in P&L" = OFF? _(seeded as false for now)_

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

- `auth.user_role()` could not be created in the `auth` schema on Supabase cloud (permission denied). Function lives in `public.user_role()` instead. All RLS policies must reference `public.user_role()`.
- Seed users were inserted directly into `auth.users` using a pre-hashed bcrypt password (`KocTest2024!`). In production, use Supabase Auth Admin API to create users properly.
- `0016_seed.sql` is included in migrations (not a separate seed file) because `supabase db query` only targets local DB. This is fine for dev — do not run on production.

---

## Useful Snippets / Things I Always Forget

```bash
# Push migrations to cloud
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>
supabase db push

# Generate TypeScript types from remote schema
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>
supabase gen types typescript --project-id drqpqjsamguffwkxiilp > types/database.ts

# Supabase project ref
drqpqjsamguffwkxiilp
```

## Session Log

### Session 3 — 2026-05-09
- **Worked on:** Piece 3 — Scaffold + Shared UI + PWA
- **Done:**
  - `lib/money.ts` + 19 passing unit tests (vitest)
  - `lib/date.ts` (Karachi timezone helpers using date-fns-tz)
  - `lib/auth/session.ts` (getSession server helper)
  - `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` + `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 renamed middleware→proxy)
  - `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` + `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` (react-hook-form + zod)
  - `app/(app)/layout.tsx` + AppShell client wrapper
  - `components/layout/{Header,Sidebar,UserMenu,AppShell}.tsx`
  - Sidebar filters items via `can(role, permission)`; mobile collapsible
  - `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` — 4 stat card placeholders
  - PWA: `next.config.ts` + `public/manifest.json` + placeholder icons 192/512
  - Root `app/layout.tsx` updated with manifest + viewport metadata
- **Notes:**
  - Next.js 16: `middleware.ts` renamed to `proxy.ts`, export renamed to `proxy`
  - Turbopack `root: __dirname` needed due to multiple lockfiles in parent dirs
  - `parsePKR` bug found + fixed in tests ("Rs. 500.50" was parsing as 0.50)

### Session 2 — 2026-05-09
- **Worked on:** Piece 2 — Auth + RLS
- **Done:**
  - `0017_rls_policies.sql`: RLS enabled on all 20 tables; 80 policies covering select/insert/update/delete; `public.user_has_business()` helper
  - `products` base table: staff/viewer see 0 rows; must use `products_for_role` VIEW
  - `lib/auth/permissions.ts`: PERMISSIONS map + `can(role, permission)`
  - `lib/auth/guards.ts`: `requireAuth()`, `requireRole(...roles)`
  - `lib/supabase/server.ts`: SSR server client (@supabase/ssr)
  - `lib/supabase/client.ts`: browser client
  - `lib/supabase/admin.ts`: service role client with browser-import guard
  - `supabase/tests/rls_smoke.sql`: 7 smoke test cases
  - All smoke tests passed; TypeScript clean
- **Notes:**
  - `purchase_price_paisa` NULL via service key without JWT is expected (no auth.uid() context)

### Session 1 — 2026-05-09
- **Worked on:** Piece 1 — Database Schema + Seed Data
- **Done:**
  - `supabase init` + linked to cloud project `drqpqjsamguffwkxiilp`
  - 15 migration files written (0001–0015), 1,098 lines total
  - Seed: 5 users, 4 businesses, 11 user_business links, 3 categories, 50 customers, 30 products, 230 stock movements, 100 invoices, 200 invoice items, 30 payments, 20 expenses, 130 ledger entries, 385 audit rows, 12 app_settings rows
  - All pushed to Supabase cloud and verified
- **Notes:**
  - `public.user_role()` moved from `auth` schema (no permission on cloud)
  - Seed uses pre-hashed bcrypt; do NOT push 0016_seed.sql to production
